# LoginDemoExample

In login application, the screen asking your credentials to login to some particular application. 
You might have seen it when logging into Instragram, facebook, twitter etc.

First you have to define two TextView asking username and password of the user. 
The password TextView must have inputType set to password. Its syntax given below 
android:inputType = "textPassword"

In this example we havn't do anything for loging attempt or not even persist any type of user data to make successful login.
it is simple login screen but in future we will do sign up and it's related login action.
